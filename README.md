<h2>üßë‚Äçüíª How I Became a Developer</h2>

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, like many, I found myself pondering life's possibilities. In March 2020, as we were asked to step away from our jobs and stay home due to safety concerns, I recognized a unique opportunity for a career change. With time at my disposal and no immediate commitments, I embarked on a long journey of coding.

Encouraged by a developer friend, I enrolled in an intensive software development program. Nine months later, I proudly graduated from Code Fellows, armed with a plethora of new skills. In March 2021, I took my first steps into the technology industry as a teaching assistant and tutor at Code Fellows and then soon found myself promoted to Lead Instructor.

Currently, my focus is on honing my problem-solving prowess, delving deeper into networking and cybersecurity, and pursuing skill certifications. 

Let's embark on this tech adventure together, shall we? üòÑ
