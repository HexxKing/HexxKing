<h3>üßë‚Äçüíª How I Became a Developer</h3>

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, like many, I found myself pondering life's possibilities. In March 2020, as we were asked to step away from our jobs and stay home due to safety concerns, I recognized a unique opportunity for a career change. With time at my disposal and no immediate commitments, I embarked on a long journey of coding.

Encouraged by a developer friend, I enrolled in an intensive software development program. Nine months later, I proudly graduated from Code Fellows, armed with a plethora of new skills. In March 2021, I took my first steps into the technology industry as a teaching assistant and tutor at Code Fellows and then soon found myself promoted to Lead Instructor.

Currently, my focus is on honing my problem-solving prowess, delving deeper into networking and cybersecurity, and pursuing CompTIA certifications. I'm committed to continuous learning and immersing myself in the technology landscape, all in pursuit of discovering my ideal role at my dream company.

Let's embark on this tech adventure together, shall we? üòÑ
